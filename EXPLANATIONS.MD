## Checklist
[Link for view](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iA8NtPqnfZfIlEBXi9ePbwnU1Lb1C8NXnt9sPy4eZTs/edit?usp=sharing).
### Why checklist? And not test cases?
- —Åhecklists are faster to create
- require much less time for maintaining (which is bit advantage)
- generally they provide the same level of clearness (as test cases)
- push QA to use mind and creativity
- do not contain extra or obvious data (e.g. steps if they are clear from summary)

### Why testcafe?
- created for UI testing
- contains embedded waits
- easy to start
- supports all popular browsers (even IE)
- supports mobile emulation 
- can work with native alerts, prompts, etc
- does not need webdriver or any additional tools (like Appium)
- supports page object pattern
- can lunch tests concurrently
- free to use

### Why I have automated that specific cases?
The first but not the only parameter is the tests priority. From the other hand I tried to use and show different functionalities which *testcafe* provides.
